## The world's first client for Lichess

Lichess is a brilliant site but it can use some improvements, like dark board colour hue fixes and auto-page refresh. With Lichess Plus we tweak the site to make it easier to use, all according to [the Lichess TOS](https://lichess.org/terms-of-service) as of 28 April 2022.
